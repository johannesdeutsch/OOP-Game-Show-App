This is the game "Phrase Hunter". A randomly chosen phrase is selected that the user tries to guess with a keyboard that is clickable on the screen. The programm has two classes: a Game and a Phrase class.
A random phrase is created, seperated into single letters and reserved on the gameboard, while it's still hidden. The player tries to guess it, and each time the user clicks a button with a letter, it's checked against the chosen phrase. If it's the correct letter, it's shown, and if it's not correct, the colour of the button changes and the player loses a life. At all, there are five lifes or chances to guess the correct phrase. If the player has guessed the phrase correctly, a winning screen is shown. If not, a message that the player lost is displayed.
